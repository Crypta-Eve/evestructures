        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>EveStructures creates a consolidated view of all your in-game player owned stations. No longer do you need to login in dozens of characters to check fuel timers, service status or even to remember all the structures you have!</p>
          <p>Now, from one view you can see everything on the fly. Structures are grouped by the character that has access to view them, and shows the most pertinent information:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Name</li> 
              <li>System</li>
              <li>Fuel Time</li> 
            </ul>
          Clicking on the structures name will take you to a more in-depth view. There you can see: 
            <ul>
              <li>services with their status</li>
              <li>current state end/start time</li>
              <li>unanchor timer</li>  
              <li>and much more!</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Create and save a <a href="https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks" target="_blank">Discord Webhook</a> for each character you want to receive notifications on. EveStructureBot will let you know when you have <7days and <24h fuel left, State of your structure changing, Unanchor warnings, and Moon Extractions!</p>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>The main benefit of EveStructures is the ability to view multiple characters in one place. Signing on through a single character means you are limited to that Characters scope. By making an account, we can now associate multiple characters to one user.</p>
          <p>Emails are used for password reset mails. You are more than welcome to use a spam, junk or burner email</p>
          <p>This also allows you to have one login for all your Station Managers in your Corporation/Alliance. <strong>It is not required for you to have your own account</strong>.</p>
